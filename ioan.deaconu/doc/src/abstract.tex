\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis proposes a new way of implementing a mobile gateway for Wireless Sensor Networks that have good uses in applications running in remote locations, where maintenance is difficult. Wireless Sensor Networks islands need a gateway connection in order to reach the outside world, but this is difficult to provide in all instances. The solution to this problem is to use a gateway mounted on a UAV that can reach those islands to mule data from them. 
This solution has been proven to be successful but the adoption was prevented by the high cost and the technical background needed to operate it. We propose a simpler ,easy to operate and cheaper solution than the similar ones.

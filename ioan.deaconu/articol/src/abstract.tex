Mobile Gateway for Wireless Sensor Networks utilizing drones

Wireless Sensor Networks have good uses in applications running in remote locations, where maintenance is difficult. WSN islands often need a connection with a gateway in order to communicate with the outside world, but this cannot be provided in all circumstances.  A different approach to connecting wireless sensor networks is to use mobile gateways that can reach the remote locations where WSN are running. Our design offers a mobile gateway that is the solution to the problem by using a SparrowDongle gateway node connected to a Parrot quadcopter Drone. This system allows us to collect data from nodes along the flight path of the drone, possibly reaching locations where a standard 3G connection can not reach.

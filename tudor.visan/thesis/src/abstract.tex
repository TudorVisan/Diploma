\chapter*{Abstract}

This paper proposes a new communication protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks
designed to take advantage of alternative energy sources. Despite improvements
in both energy efficiency and sensing capabilities Wireless Sensor Networks are
still limited because of the limited battery life of their nodes. Similar 
protocols focus on low energy consumption to the detriment of bandwidth and network
responsiveness and never take into account the actual environment around the
nodes. Our approach is based on harvesting and storing energy
from the surrounding environment is order to enable longer and more
intense periods of activity while preserving battery life. . Through this
technique data loads within Wireless Sensor Networks may increase thus allowing
more precise and complex measurements and greater network size, all while
preserving node lifespans.

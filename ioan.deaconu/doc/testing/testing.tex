\chapter{Testing}

The tests that we have conducted highlights the strengths of the platform but also reveals some of its weaknesses.
The most important characteristics of this experiment the maximum hight that the drone  can achive with extra gear, the maximum range of the wireless network and the maximum range of the dongle .

Tests show the maximum range at which a drone can still comunicate with base or with a SparrowV3.2,


\section{Scenario}

The testing method included the dongle with the standard antena, a 3 dbi and a 8 dbi external antena.
The nodes were palced at the ground with the antena directed to us.

\section{Results}

The top mounted antenna worked, but for a better signal, the atenna should allways be possitioned on the bottom of the drone becase in this way, the antena will have a clear path to send and receive signal and not have the signal go through the entire drone and its avionics.

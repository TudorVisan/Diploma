\chapter{Future Work}

Even though the solution is working, new application and functionalities can be added. The application can be from opposing worlds, such as search and rescue versus military.


\section{Features not implemented}

\subsection{Debug}

A feature that can be used in conventional wireless sensor networks is to determine the source of communication failure. If the gateway detects that the network has a communication problem and not all of the previous nodes can be reached, this information will be send to the drone and it will try to find and determine which nodes are working properly and which nodes are not.

\subsection{Truly Autonomous flight}
The AR Parrot Drone 2.0 can perform autonomous flight with a GPS module, but only while it is still in the range of the Wi-Fi connection. This feature will allow the drone to fly without the need to still be connected through Wi-Fi to a controlling device.

Also, a different autonomous flight can be performed without a GPS module if the signal strength of the nodes is used to performed flight correction and determine the speed and direction of the drone.


\section{Possible Applications}

\subsection{Treasure Hunt Games}
A treasure hunt game can be played by placing the nodes with information regarding the location of the treasure at certain hidden spots and trying to find the treasure by following the clues provided by the drone.

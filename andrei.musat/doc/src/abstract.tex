A Lightweight, Versatile Gateway Platform for Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless Sensor Networks enable the Internet of Things through their many applications, and as such require multiple, flexible gateway platforms. Gateways in Wireless Sensor Networks are bulky, difficult to use devices requiring special deployment and extra programming effort. We designed a lightweight, extremely portable, dual-processor USB device with an optional external antenna. Our design proves to be versatile both on the USB side, where it can appear as a serial connection or a wireless network interface, and on the RF side, where it matches the hardware of our wireless sensor platform, and therefore shares much of its codebase. The wireless USB device can be used standalone with any PC, and for extra portability it can be attached to a small Linux device (such as RaspberryPi), making it suitable for any wireless sensor network application, both indoor and outdoor.

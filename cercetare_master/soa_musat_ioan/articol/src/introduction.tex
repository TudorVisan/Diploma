Wireless Sensor Networks are a very low cost, low power device optimized to perform custom tasks. They usualy gather informations from the souroundings, informations which can be send to a gateway. The gateway is usualy connected to a more powerfull device, for example, a laptop, that can analize the received informations and take certain actions based on the results. Because the information is important in certain cases, security protocols are implemented to prevent attacks that can alter the data or that can gather the data.

The current frameworks offer a high security level, but in order to achive that level of security, a lot of power is wasted on ... to be continued...

In this paper we will present a low power security created specialy for a long range wireless sensor network.

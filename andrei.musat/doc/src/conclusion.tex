The paper presented a routing algorithm which uses newer algorithms and
programming techniques to achieve results which convey information better
through organization. The user is able to get a better overall picture as 
well as see any details of the nodes. In addition, it is easily customizable to meet the needs and 
preferences of any user.

The algorithm clearly separates its two functionalities, allowing the 
user to customize whichever algorithm feels unsuitable, making the 
final diagrams feel more natural and easily understandable.

\section{Standard WSN Protocols}

The protocols implemented in Wireless Sensor Network are based on sourounding node discovery in order to build a topology and find the best way they can multihop data to the gateway. This approach works best in a static environment, but in a dynamic environment or an eviroment were the distance between nodes is too big or the time between two data packets is too big, the network convergence will be slow or not even possible.

\section{Crop Monitoring}

A reasearch of using a drone for crop monitoring has been conducted at a vineyard. Their system was comprised of a unamed quadcopter, an arduino with a gprs module for theoretical long distance communication with drone, but the drone was controlled using a Spektrum DX7SE 2.4 GHz remote control and ZigBee and Crossbowâ€™s TelosB as the nodes.

They demonstrated that a preprogramed UAV can be used to monitor multiple crops were a standard WSN can not be applied because of the unique constrains imposed by the the environment.

The cost of the implementation was relatively high compared to ours, the remote is 300\$, the same as the entire drone that we propose and the TelosB is 99\$. This data suggests that for their experiment the drone with arduino and the gprs module, and the remote control were half the cost of the equipment.

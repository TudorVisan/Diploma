An experimental analysis on the viability of software AES in Wireless Sensor Networks

Wireless sensor networks are a cheap and versatile solution for monitoring various environments.
The data gathered by these networks is often used in research projects and scientifical experiments.
It is necessary to ensure that a certain level of security and protection is applied on the transmitted 
data. Current software security methods implemented on wireless sensor networks do not necessarily take 
into consideration the lifetime and autonomy of the nodes. This paper presents an analysis of a software 
AES implementation on wireless sensor nodes and shows a comparison between the viability of such a 
method with regard to hardware AES.

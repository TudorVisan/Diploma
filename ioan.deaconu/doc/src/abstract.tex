This thesis proposes a new way of implementing a mobile gateway for Wireless Sensor Networks that simplifies applications running in remote locations, where maintenance is difficult. Wireless Sensor Networks islands need a gateway connection in order to reach the outside world, but this is difficult to provide in all instances. The solution to this problem is to use a gateway mounted on a UAV that can reach those islands and extract data from them.
This solution has been proven to be successful but adoption is low because of the high cost and the technical background needed to operate it. We propose a simpler, easier to operate and cheaper solution for this problem.

\chapter{Conclusions}

With the current technological advances, we are more and more used to things that make our lives more simpler and give us informations at the tip of our finger. 

The Wireless Sensor Networks are expanding more and more because they make our lives simpler by giving us informations about our surroundings. But the standard way of creating this islands is not always feasible.

The main purpose of this thesis was to bring an alternative at how the data is muled from the Wireless Sensor Network islands. The solution, a truly mobile gateway is a viable one and it can be implemented with a relatively low cost and no extra knowledge, other than knowing how to use a smartphone.

The solution is not in its final state and can be improved by adding new features.

A feature that can be used in conventional wireless sensor networks is to determine the source of communication failure. If the gateway detects that the network has a communication problem and not all of the previous nodes can be reached, this information will be send to the drone and it will try to find and determine which nodes are working properly and which nodes are not.
 
The AR Parrot Drone 2.0 can perform autonomous flight with a GPS module, but only while it is still in the range of the Wi-Fi connection. This feature will allow the drone to fly without the need to still be connected through Wi-Fi to a controlling device. Also, a different autonomous flight can be performed without a GPS module if the signal strength of the nodes is used to performed flight correction and determine the speed and direction of the drone.


Besides the practicality aspect of the solution, it can be used as a fun instrument to. 

A treasure hunt game can be played by placing the nodes with information regarding the location of the treasure at certain hidden spots and trying to find the treasure by following the clues provided by the drone.

Other fun game is by hiding the nodes in a certain zone. The players must find as many nodes as possible in that zone before they run out of juice. The winner will be the player that found the biggest number of nodes and has the best time.

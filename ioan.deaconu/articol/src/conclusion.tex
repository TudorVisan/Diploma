The paper presented a versatile gateway platform for wireless sensor networks
that is both capable of serving current application needs as well as offer the
ability to interface sensor networks in a novel way (sensor data as files). 

The platform is easy-to-use and to program due to clear separation of
communication mediums on different controllers and benefits from the
elimination of code duplication in the case of the radio controller unit.

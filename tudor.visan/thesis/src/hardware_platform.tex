\chapter{Hardware platform}

This protocol was developed and tested entirely on the Sparrowv3 wireless
sensing platform. This platform was developed by Sl. Dr. Ing. Dan Tudose, As.
Drd. Ing. Andrei Voinescu and As. Drd. Ing. Dan Dragomir at the Faculty of
Automatic Control and Computers, University Politehnica of Bucharest. The
development kit consists of Sparrowv3 sensing nodes and the SparrowDongle usb stick.

Together, the sensing nodes and usb dongle form a tool for developing and
debugging applications that are IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee compatible. Such
applications range from environmental monitoring and data logging to wildlife
research.

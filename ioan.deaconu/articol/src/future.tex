The versatility of the platform makes it ideal to be deployed in a wide range of applications, especialy those of which environment is dinamic.

For instance, some possible applications in which the drone can be deployed are:

 \begin{itemize} 

\item  Autonomus collection of data data by adding a gps receiver to the drone and setting path waypoints to follow\cite{fcint}

\item Debuging a wireless sensor network by checking which node is working, the connection logs and the physical state of the device

\item Search and rescue operations, especialy when going skiing in a avalanche prone enviroment by wearing a wireless sensor. 

\item Creating a small wireless sensor network for a limited time with small costs and large battery life

\item Treasure hunt where the sensors can hold the clues that lead to the location of the treasure

 
\end{itemize}

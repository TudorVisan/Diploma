Mobile Gateway for Wireless Sensor Networks utilizing drones

The use of Wireless Sensor Networks is increasing and are being used in places were maintenance is difficult. Because of the power limitations, the nodes have a transmission range of only a few tens of meters which results in creating a multi-hop wireless sensor network architecture in order to send the data from any node to a gateway. But in some cases, creating this type of network might be to difficult or to expensive. Our design offers a truly mobile gateway using a SparrowDongle connected to a Parrot Drone. This setup allows us not only to collect data from a node, but also to debug a wireless sensor network.

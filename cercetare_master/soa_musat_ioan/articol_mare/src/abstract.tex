A wireless sensor network application used to monitor earthquake and assess risk of urban damage

Wireless sensor networks are a cheap and versatile solution for monitoring various environments 
and elements of an environment. There exists a number of such applications used worldwide to monitor 
areas in which human access is hard or near impossible. The issue with these applications is that 
they are mainly used by government organizations or for research purposes. They seldom focus on 
using the data in the interest of safety for the population, such as warning them of natural 
disasters or assessing the risk of damaged areas left in the wake of a natural disaster. The 
solution we propose in this article is used to monitor earthquakes and the status of urban structures 
exposed to earthquakes or other sources of vibration in order to prevent possible disasters.

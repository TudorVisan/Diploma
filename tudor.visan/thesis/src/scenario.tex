\chapter{Scenario}

We propose a simple application to analyze the behaviour of the protocol. 

The scenario is of a home monitoring application, in order to detect gas leaks.
The Sparrowv3 nodes have been equipped with methane sensors and the house has
an alarm system. If methane levels increase past a threshold value, the alarm
must be raised.
